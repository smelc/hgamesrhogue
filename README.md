#hgamesrhogue

A library that I use in my roguelike [Dungeon Mercenary](http://www.schplaf.org/hgames). Only depends on the Java library and on [SquidLib](https://github.com/SquidPony/SquidLib)'s `Coord` and `IColoredString` classes. This library contains roguelike-oriented code.

* Code in this library is Java 1.6 compliant, as required by most Android versions.
* Code in this library is [GWT](www.gwtproject.org/) compliant.

Code in this library is in the public domain (see LICENSE).
