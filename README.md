#hgamesrhogue

A library that I use in my roguelike [Dungeon Mercenary](http://www.schplaf.org/hgames). Only depends on the Java library and on [SquidLib]()'s `Coord` class (until I duplicate it). This library contains roguelike-oriented code.

Code in this library is in the public domain (see LICENSE).
